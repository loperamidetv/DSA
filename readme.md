# Roadmap
## Linked list 

I'm actually refactoring some code right now. Writing the way I wrote, it raised some problems, especially code repetition, lack of readability, use of unnecessary ressources, etc... 

I've read some pretty neat ressources about DSA and my goal is to implement them the best I can. 

### Here's the new roadmap : 
#### List creation and extension
* ~~Struct creation ~~
* ~~Insert a element at the begining of the list~~
* ~~display a list~~
* ~~Insert at the end of the list~~
* Insert at the n-th position

#### Removing elements and destruction of the list
* Remove at the begining
* Remove at the end
* Remove at the n-th position 
* Remove all the element and destruction of the list

#### For the future...
For now, I'm gonna implement what I planned to do, in the future we will see...

### Here is the "old roadmap":

* ~~Insert at index~~
* ~~Get element at index~~
* ~~Delete the first occurence of element~~
* ~~Check if value exists~~
* ~~Delete element at index~~
* ~~Delete the list properly without memory leaks~~
* ~~Insert at the end of the list~~
* ~~Creation, initialization~~
